Welcome to my first project website!

The AnoSTEP larval collection is a key component of the **AnoSTEP-Afrika Project**, a collaborative, multi-country initiative led by the Ifakara Health Institute. The primary goal of the project is to understand the distribution, behavior, and public health impact of the invasive malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi, across various ecological zones in Africa.

The larval collection specifically involves:

Training field teams: Scientists and field teams are trained to identify Anopheles stephensi habitats, collect and sort mosquito larvae, and enter the data into electronic forms.

Habitat characterization: The collection efforts focus on identifying and characterizing the types of water bodies where Anopheles stephensi larvae are found. This includes assessing factors like water sources, vegetation, and other environmental conditions.

Data-driven surveillance: By collecting larvae from various sites, the project aims to establish a robust surveillance system to track the spread of Anopheles stephensi and understand its bionomics (life cycle and habits) in new African settings.

This larval collection is crucial for developing targeted and effective control strategies against this emerging threat to malaria control, particularly in urban and peri-urban areas where the vector thrives. The data gathered helps to inform national and regional strategies and builds local capacity to respond to the growing challenge.
